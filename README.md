# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification System 🌿

This project is a microservice-based application for plant disease classification using gRPC for communication between a FastAPI client and a PyTorch-based machine learning backend. It classifies plant diseases from images and organizes the data for future dataset creation.

## 🚀 Features

- **🛠 gRPC-based microservices**: Efficient communication between the FastAPI client and ML inference service.
- **🧠 Machine Learning**: Uses PyTorch models for vegetable type and plant disease detection.
- **📦 Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns for scalability and flexibility.
- **⚡ FastAPI for HTTP API**: Provides an interface for uploading images and receiving classification results.
- **📝 Logging and Data Handling**: Logs all requests and stores predicted data for future use.

    uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload
    ```

### 🐧 Linux / 🍎 macOS

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-classification.git
    cd plant-disease-classification
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r server/requirements.txt
    pip install -r fastapi_app/requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and modifying it:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. Run the gRPC server:
    ```bash
    python3 server/app.py
    ```

6. Run the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload
    ```

## 📡 API Usage

1. **Start the servers**:
   - Run the gRPC server: 
     ```bash
     python server/app.py
     ```
   - Run the FastAPI server:
     ```bash
     uvicorn fastapi_app.main:app --reload
     ```

2. **API Request Example (CURL)**:
   ```bash
   curl -X 'POST' \
   'http://127.0.0.1:8000/classify' \
   -H 'accept: application/json' \
   -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
   -F 'crop=cauliflower' \
   -F 'image=@your-image-file.png'
   ```

3. **API Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "disease": "Black Rot"
   }
   ```

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables to manage paths and ports. The variables include:
- `BASE_DIR`: Base directory for data and logs.
- `LOG_DIR`: Directory for storing log files.
- `GRPC_PORT`: Port for gRPC server communication.

## 🧑‍💻 How it Works

1. **FastAPI** accepts image upload and crop details from the user.
2. The FastAPI server forwards the request to the gRPC service.
3. **gRPC** service runs PyTorch models to predict the disease based on the image.
4. Results are returned to the FastAPI client, and the response is sent back to the user.
